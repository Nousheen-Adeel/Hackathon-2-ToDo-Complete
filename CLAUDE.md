# Using Specs to Generate Code

This document provides instructions on how to use our specification files to generate code.

## Overview
The spec-driven development approach uses detailed specification documents to guide the implementation of features. The following process should be followed:

1. Read the spec.md file to understand the requirements
2. Consult the plan.md file for the implementation strategy
3. Review tasks.md for specific implementation steps
4. Generate code that aligns with all three documents

## Spec File Usage
- **spec.md**: Contains the detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **plan.md**: Outlines the approach and architecture for implementation
- **tasks.md**: Lists granular steps needed to complete the implementation

## Best Practices
- Always refer to the spec files before implementing
- Update spec files if requirements change during development
- Ensure generated code matches the specifications exactly
- Add comments referencing spec sections where appropriate
